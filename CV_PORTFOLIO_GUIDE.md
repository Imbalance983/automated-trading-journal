## 🎤 Interview Talking Points

### Challenge 1: Balance Calculation Accuracy
**Problem**: Initial calculation summed all coins ($199k), not matching trader expectations
**Solution**: Switched to USDT-only equity (~$395) matching Bybit UI
**Result**: Accurate balance that matches user expectations

### Challenge 2: Loading State Management
**Problem**: Functions called before definition causing frozen loading
**Solution**: Reordered functions, added null-safety, 5-second timeout
**Result**: Zero loading bugs, guaranteed UI responsiveness

### Challenge 3: Real-time Data Sync
**Problem**: Sync 90 days of trades with API limitations
**Solution**: Chunked fetching with 7-day windows, cursor pagination
**Result**: Successfully syncs thousands of trades without duplicates
